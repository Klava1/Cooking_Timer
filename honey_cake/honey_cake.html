    <h2>Honey Cake (Medovik)</h2>
    <p id="description">
      Ryzhik, pchelka, medyanik, smetannik — these are all nicknames for perhaps the most ancient Russian cake —
      Medovik. The story of its origin is somewhat dubious, but it grants this cake the title of being royal. Today,
      this honey dessert has undergone many changes. The cream can be either creamy or sour cream-based, nuts are added
      into the layers or sprinkled on top of the cake. But all this does not hinder the boundless love for the most
      famous Russian sweet or "zaedki," as they were called before.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Honey - 280 g</li>
      <li>Butter - 64 g</li>
      <li>Chicken Egg - 4 pieces</li>
      <li>Sugar - 60 g</li>
      <li>Wheat Flour - 268 g</li>
      <li>Baking Soda - 8 g</li>
      <li>20% Fat Sour Cream - 300 g</li>
      <li>Powdered Sugar - 75 g</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cooking Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place a saucepan with water on the stove, let it heat well. Place a bowl with honey on top, wait until it
        becomes liquid, add pieces of butter. Stir the mixture with a whisk until the butter dissolves and leave it on
        the stove on low heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the meantime, start whipping sugar and eggs at high speed: this will take about eight minutes, resulting in a
        strong white cream.
      </li>
      <li>Mix flour with baking soda and sift through a sieve: this will make the layers lighter.</li>
      <li>
        By this time, the honey mixture should have a brownish tint. Remove it from the heat, introduce the egg mixture
        and mix with a whisk, making movements from top to bottom. Add flour and mix again, but this time from bottom to
        top.
      </li>
      <li>
        For the cake, you will need six layers, each 20 cm in diameter and 2 mm thick. In production, they use metal
        rings, but at home, you can shape the layers by eye. Some of the dough will remain: it needs to be baked as a
        single layer — it will go for the honey crumb for decoration.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the home oven to the highest possible temperature and bake the layers for three to four minutes: they
        should become the color of buckwheat honey and remain soft. When they are ready, put them in the refrigerator to
        cool.
      </li>
      <li>Make the sour cream: mix powdered sugar and sour cream with a whisk until smooth.</li>
      <li>
        Assemble the cake: lay the first layer with the baked side up, spread with cream, and the following layers —
        with the baked side down. Also spread cream on the top. Grind the extra layer in a blender to a fine crumb.
        Sprinkle it on all sides of the cake.
      </li>
      <li>
        The finished cake can be decorated with powdered sugar and honey, then put in the refrigerator overnight, or
        better for a day: during this time, it will settle about one and a half times and soak with cream.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p id="par">
      Let the finished cake stand for at least overnight: the layers will soak with cream during this time, and the
      taste will become more intense.
